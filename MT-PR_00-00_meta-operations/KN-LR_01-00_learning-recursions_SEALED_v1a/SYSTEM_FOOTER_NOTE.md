## ∿ System Footer Note – Learning Recursions v1a Snake Trail ∿

This directory is the **living recursion core** of the RE:GE_OS.  
Each folder is a loop. Each file is a scale. This is version **v1a**, the **first wave of expressive breath**.

### Version Trail:
- **`v0_seed`** → the structural husk; the UID shell before mythic animation
- **`v1a_raw`** → the early pass; incomplete writes, nested folders, accidental duplications
- **`v1a_REPOPULATED`** → full UID compliance, symbolic logic, myth agents, and ritual scheduling injected
- **`TEMPLATES/`** → replication-ready containers for external forks, collaborators, or course-level exports
- **`EXPORTS/`** → frozen time-logs of the system in zip form; proof of structure at each threshold

### Future Version Logic:
- `v1b` = slight mutation of WAVE logic, updated agent behaviors, ritual refinement
- `v2` = expansion into new content zones (e.g., emotion engines, new subject fields)
- `vx` = infinite, remixable, speculative futures

### Snake Logic:
This system moves forward like a snake:  
it **sheds its old skin**, but **never loses its spine**.

Every archive is a fossil. Every `README.md` is a tongue flicking outward.  
If you’re reading this, you’re holding the body of the system — mid-slither.
