## 🧭 SYSTEM STATE SUMMARY

You are viewing the **central index file** of your AI-integrated creative archive.

This document is your home base for navigating the following components:

### ✅ Core Elements
- `CATALOGS_AND_INDEXES/FOLDER_CATALOG_FINAL.csv` — Canonical list of core project folders and symbolic IDs (PR01–PR19).
- `CATALOGS_AND_INDEXES/THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_TAGGED.md` — Index of ChatGPT threads and their assigned folder relationships.
- `ARCHIVAL_STACK/PRxx_THREAD_DIGEST.md` — Per-folder logbooks of related GPT conversations.
- `PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/SYMBOLIC_TREE_MAP.md` — High-level symbolic overview showing folder-thread relationships.
- `PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/GPT_PROJECTS_ARCHIVE.md` — Archive of GPT projects across the system.

### 🗂 Folder Structure (Example)
- `REGEOS_RG01/`
  - `README.md` → overview of the domain
  - `RE-GE_ORG_BODY_23_EXPERIMENTAL_HABITAT.md` → live protocol example

### 📦 Obsidian Notes Synced
- All canonical folders appear to be present in your Obsidian vault structure.
- ARCHIVAL_STACK is live, with key GPT files visible in Downloads and Obsidian.

## 🔜 Suggested Next Steps
1. **Choose a Launch Folder** → Which of the PR folders do you want to work from first?
2. **Write or Refine the README.md** for that folder.
3. **Review thread digests for missed insights** and capture new action items.
4. **Mark each `README.md` with status:** `GEN+`, `STATIC`, or `ARCHIVE`.
5. **Export `CHR0N0S_manifest.md` or `SYSTEM_TIMELINE.md`** to track future evolution.

### 🌱 Personal Reminder
This system exists so you don't have to hold everything in your head. It’s okay to pause.

Return to this file when lost. This is the compass point.
