# Historical & Cultural Contexts

## Hans Christian Andersen’s *The Little Mermaid* (1837)

The original Danish fairy tale is far more tragic and philosophical than most modern retellings. The mermaid sacrifices her voice to gain legs and a human soul, hoping to win the prince’s love. However, he marries another woman. The mermaid is offered the chance to kill him and return to the sea—but she refuses, choosing instead to dissolve into sea foam. Because of her selflessness, she becomes a "daughter of the air," given a path to immortality through good deeds. The story reflects 19th-century Christian values around sacrifice, the soul, and moral purity, rather than romantic fulfillment.

---

## Disney’s *The Little Mermaid* (1989)

Disney’s adaptation, while inspired by Andersen, reimagines the mermaid as a teenage heroine rebelling against paternal control. Ariel’s voice, exchanged for legs, becomes a symbol of female agency and identity—though the film resolves with marriage and restored voice. Released at the end of the Reagan era, it reflected a cultural blend of emerging post-feminist discourse and traditional family values. The film was part of the Disney Renaissance, representing a new golden age of animation focused on musical spectacle, princess empowerment, and feel-good resolution—especially for Western audiences.

## Studio Ghibli & Miyazaki’s Vision

Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Studio Ghibli and director of *Ponyo*, draws deeply from Japanese philosophical and spiritual traditions, particularly Shinto. In this worldview, nature is animate, sacred, and emotionally interwoven with human life. Magic in Miyazaki’s films is often inseparable from emotion or imbalance—appearing not as rules to control, but forces to harmonize with. *Ponyo* reflects a postmodern ecological ethic: it centers not on conquest or punishment, but mutual understanding and the restoration of cosmic balance. Instead of a romantic arc, the film offers a tender, open-ended vision of childhood love as a healing force—an idea deeply embedded in both Japanese aesthetics and environmentalism.
