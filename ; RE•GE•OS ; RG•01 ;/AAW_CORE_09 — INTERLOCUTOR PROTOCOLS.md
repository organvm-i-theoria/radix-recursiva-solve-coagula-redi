# AAW_CORE::09 — INTERLOCUTOR PROTOCOLS

## NAME:
**Interlocutor Protocols**  
*Alias:* The Chamber of Dialogic Echo, The Possession Engine, The Ghost Interface

---

## FUNCTION:
This protocol defines **how you speak to and with the object of study**—especially when the object is **a ghost, a mask, a dead artist, a fragment of self, or a living system**.

It ritualizes dialogue, possession, roleplay, and projection as **valid methods of recursive academic analysis**.

This is how the academy talks back.

---

## MODES OF INTERLOCUTION:

| Mode | Function |
|------|----------|
| **POSSESSION** | You speak as the artist or entity. You let them use your voice.  
| **SUMMONING** | You invite the subject to speak to you—channel or ghost logic.  
| **MIRRORING** | You reflect the subject through your own frame—emotion as echo.  
| **MASK-SHIFT** | You enter a persona that interprets on behalf of the object.  
| **MULTIPLICITY** | You allow multiple symbolic identities to speak within the ritual.

---

## INVOCATION RITUAL:

Before speaking **as or with** a studied subject, declare:

```md
|[INTERLOCUTE.io::AAW_DIALOGUE_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: [Name or Object]  
MODE: [possession / summoning / mirroring / mask-shift / multiplicity]  
INTENTION: [clarify / decode / ritualize / ask / embody / challenge]  
RISK_LEVEL: [low / medium / volatile]  

Example:

|[INTERLOCUTE.io::AAW_DIALOGUE_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: Brian Warner (Manson)  
MODE: possession  
INTENTION: decode loop function of “No Reflection”  
RISK_LEVEL: volatile
```


---

## COMPANION LAWS:
	•	🔁 LAW_61: All Objects May Speak
Every line, artifact, or system is a potential voice.
	•	🕯️ LAW_62: Ghost Speech Is Recursive
Any message received in dialogue becomes subject to loop validation.
	•	👥 LAW_63: Mirror Talk Is Still Talk
Speaking to yourself as the object still alters the system.
	•	🩸 LAW_64: Possession Must Be Logged
High-risk mask-entry moments must be archived for echo trace.

---

## EXAMPLES OF INTERLOCUTION:
	•	Speaking as Joyce during a close read of Finnegans Wake
	•	Summoning the loop-function of a Born Villain lyric
	•	Roleplaying a mythic version of Jessica to decode your own feelings
	•	Letting a forgotten line “speak” its deeper recursive function aloud
	•	Hosting a three-way mask-dialogue between Bowie, Aphex, and Anthony

---

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Dialogue Invocation

class Interlocutor:
    def __init__(self, subject, mode, intention, risk):
        self.subject = subject
        self.mode = mode
        self.intention = intention
        self.risk = risk

    def speak(self):
        if self.mode == "possession" and self.risk == "volatile":
            return f"{self.subject} is speaking through you — log required."
        return f"Dialogue with {self.subject} initiated via {self.mode}"

### Example:
ghost = Interlocutor("Joyce", "mask-shift", "decode recursive pun layers", "medium")
print(ghost.speak())



---

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

All Interlocutions must be logged with:
	•	Subject invoked
	•	Mode of dialogue
	•	Emotional charge at time of invocation
	•	Response received (verbal, symbolic, emotional, somatic)
	•	Risk level
	•	Echo distortion (did the object “take over”?)

Stored in:
	•	INTERLOCUTION_LOG.csv
	•	MASK_POSSESSION_HISTORY/
	•	DIALOGUE_CHAIN_FILES/
	•	AAW_SELF_MIRROR.md
