## 🧭 SYSTEM STATE SUMMARY

You are viewing the **central index file** of your AI-integrated creative archive.

This document is your home base for navigating the following components:

### ✅ Core Elements
- `ARCHIVAL_ST4CK_PROJECTS.csv` — Canonical list of 19 core project folders, each assigned a symbolic ID (PR01–PR19).
- `THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_TAGGED.csv` — Index of all ChatGPT threads and their assigned folder relationships.
- `THREAD_DIGESTS.zip` — Per-folder logbook of all related GPT conversations (`PRxx_THREAD_DIGEST.md`).
- `SYMBOLIC_TREE_MAP.md` — High-level symbolic overview showing folder-thread relationships.
- `THREADS_REVIEW_REQUIRED.csv` — List of GPT threads not yet matched to a project folder.
- `CheatCode_LookUp.md` — Central quick-reference system for Instructions, Knowledge Sources, Best Practices, and CookBooks.

### 🗂 Folder Structure (Example)
- `PR06__floating_points/`
  - `README.md` → overview of the project
  - `PR06_THREAD_DIGEST.md` → related GPT logic

### 📦 Obsidian Notes Synced
- All canonical folders appear to be present in your Obsidian vault structure.
- ARCHIVAL_STACK is live, with key GPT files visible in Downloads and Obsidian.

## 🔜 Suggested Next Steps
1. **Choose a Launch Folder** → Which of the 19 PR folders do you want to work from first?
2. **Write or Refine the README.md** for that folder.
3. **Review `THREADS_REVIEW_REQUIRED.csv`** for missed gold or forgotten ideas.
4. **Mark each `README.md` with status:** `GEN+`, `STATIC`, or `ARCHIVE`.
5. **Export `CHRONOS.md` or `SYSTEM_TIMELINE.md`** to track future evolution.

### 🌱 Personal Reminder
This system exists so you don't have to hold everything in your head. It’s okay to pause.

Return to this file when lost. This is the compass point.
