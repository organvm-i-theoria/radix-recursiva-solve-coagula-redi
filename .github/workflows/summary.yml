      # Note: The 'actions/ai-inference@v1' action does not exist.
      # This is a placeholder for a future AI inference action.
      # To implement this functionality, you can:
      # 1. Use a third-party action like 'james-carroll/llm-action@v1' with an OpenAI API key
      # 2. Create a custom action that calls an AI API
      # 3. Use a GitHub App or service that provides AI summarization
      # Example alternative implementation:
      # - name: Run AI inference
      #   id: inference
      #   run: |
      #     # Custom script to call AI API and generate summary
      #     echo "response=Issue summary would go here" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
