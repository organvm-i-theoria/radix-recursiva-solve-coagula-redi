# 4_S0VRC3 — Radix Recursiva: Solve, Coagula, Redī

> A living specification that implements itself.

---

## The Problem

Creative knowledge management systems fragment across tools, lose context over time, and lack meaningful organization that reflects how creative work actually evolves. Folders and tags are not enough—they impose static structure on dynamic, recursive creative processes.

## The Approach

4_S0VRC3 implements RE:GE:OS (Recursive Generative Operating System)—a symbolic operating system where:

- **The vault structure IS the specification** — organizing principles encoded in directory layout
- **Naming conventions encode meaning** — consonant-only UIDs create semantic identifiers
- **22 organizational bodies** map creative functions to mythic archetypes
- **Experimental code lives in safe containment** — the Habitat System isolates experiments
- **The specification implements itself** — documentation and implementation are unified

The repository name tells the story: *radix-recursiva–solve–coagula–redī* — root recursion, dissolve and coagulate, return. Alchemical transformation through recursive self-reference.

## The Outcome

A self-documenting creative system with built-in knowledge transfer, emergency recovery procedures, and clear pathways from experimentation to production. The vault serves as master database for all creative work—writing, protocols, myths, and documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -e .
habitat-demo
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full command reference and development setup.

## Key Specifications

- **UID Constitution** — Consonant-only naming convention for semantic identifiers
- **22 Bodies of RE:GE:OS** — Organizational archetypes (Code Forge, Echo Shell, Dream Council, etc.)
- **Experimental Habitat System** — Safe containment for code experiments with lifecycle: Spawn → Run → Graduate/Compost
- **SOP Framework** — Daily/weekly/monthly operational rhythms

---

## The Experimental Habitat System

The Python package at `src/habitat/` is a zero-dependency containment sandbox that manages the full lifecycle of code experiments within the RE:GE:OS framework.

### Architecture

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ExperimentalHabitat` | Isolation boundaries with hierarchical nesting |
| `ExperimentalSystem` | Experiment objects with hypothesis tracking and state management |
| `ContainmentBoundary` | Hierarchical isolation structure for safe execution |
| `RecursiveMythEngine` | Symbolic and mythic processing layer |
| `HabitatManager` | CLI management interface for all habitat operations |

### Lifecycle

```
Spawn → Run → { Graduate | Compost }
```

Experiments are spawned within containment boundaries, run with full hypothesis tracking, and either graduate into the broader system or are composted back as learning material. No experiment is wasted — even failure feeds the recursive loop.

### Entry Points

After installation (`pip install -e .`), four console commands are available:

- `habitat-manager` — Full habitat containment system management
- `habitat-interactive` — Interactive habitat interface for exploration
- `habitat-demo` — Quick demonstration of core concepts
- `habitat-workflow` — Complete workflow demonstration end-to-end

## Symbolic UID Naming Convention

All identifiers in this system follow a consonant-only UID convention — vowels are stripped or encoded numerically to create dense, semantically meaningful identifiers. The repository UID `4_S0VRC3` itself follows this pattern.

Directory suffixes encode organizational function:
- `RG01` — RE:GE:OS core
- `RK01` — Archive
- `MR01` — Mirror
- `TP01` — Templates
- `TA01` — Tags
- `SM01` — System Map

This naming system is frozen as of 2025-05-04 and serves as the constitutional basis for all vault operations.
