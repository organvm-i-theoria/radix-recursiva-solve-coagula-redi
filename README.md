# 4_S0VRC3

This is the unified origin point for Anthony James Padavano's recursive creative system.  
All writing, protocols, myths, digests, and documents begin or pass through this vault.

## 🔍 Meaning
"4_S0VRC3" is read as “A Source.”  
It is both a symbolic node and a practical sandbox.

- `4` = Identity signature, recursion, transformation
- `S0VRC3` = Archive, library, wellspring, generative base

## 📍 Path
`- ~/iCloud Drive/4_S0VRC3/`
`+ ~/Documents/4_S0VRC3/`

## 📦 Contents
- `/4JP/` — Personal logs, notes, and authorship
- `/REGEOS/` — Recursive system operating structure
- `/PROJECTS/` — Active multimedia and narrative builds
- `/TEMPLATES/` — Repeatable structures and seed files
- `/THREAD_DIGESTS/` — Captured conversations and iterations


## 🤖 Commit Agent
The repository includes a lightweight commit agent script (`scripts/commit_agent.py`) and a GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/commit-agent.yml`). The agent reviews commit messages in pull requests for basic quality checks and offers a `safe_merge` helper for local use.

Run `python scripts/commit_agent.py` to critique commit messages or pass `--merge <source> <target>` to perform a merge with safety checks.
